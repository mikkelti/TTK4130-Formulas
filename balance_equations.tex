\section{Kinematics of flow}
\subsection{Material derivative}
Let $\mathbf{x}$ be the position of some fluid particle, with velocity $\dot{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{v}$. Further, let $\varphi$ be some quantity related to the particle, e.g. its temperature. The material derivative of $\varphi$ is then defined as
\begin{equation}
    \frac{D\varphi}{Dt} = \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v}^\top \nabla \varphi
\end{equation}
Bernoulli's equation for stationary frictionless flow along a streamline for an incompressible fluid
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{2} (v_2^2 - v_1^2) + \frac{p_2 - p_1}{\rho} + (z_2 - z_1)g = 0
\end{equation}
Internal energy, enthalpy, heat capacities and temperature
\begin{align}
    h = c_p T\\
    u = c_v T
\end{align}
Note that all quantities (except temperature) are specific (per unit mass) in these equations.
